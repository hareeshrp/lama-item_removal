# Object Removal Pipeline using SAM + LaMa

This project integrates **Segment Anything Model (SAM)** by Meta and **LaMa (Look-at-the-mask)** by SAIC-AI to perform high-quality object removal in images. It allows users to semantically select and erase unwanted elements from images with visually realistic inpainting.

---

## Pipeline Overview

1. **SAM** segments the input image into 100+ object masks.
2. **User selects and combines** desired masks into a single binary mask.
3. **LaMa** uses this mask to remove unwanted regions and inpaint with context-aware reconstruction.

---

## SAM: Segment Anything Model

We use SAM to break down an image into many fine-grained mask segments.

**Original Image**  
![Original](outputs/input4.png)

**Example Segment Mask**  
![Single Mask Example](outputs/0.png)

> (You can optionally show a grid of all 100+ masks if you want)

---

## Combining Selected Masks

You can programmatically or visually choose 2â€“5 relevant masks and merge them:

```python
# combine_selected_masks.py
selected_files = ["0.png", "2.png", "3.png"]
```

**Combined Binary Mask**

> White regions indicate the area to be removed.

## Object Removal with LaMa

A custom Python script runs the full LaMa pipeline:

- Resizes the image and mask
- Runs LaMa prediction
- Resizes the output to original resolution

```bash
python3 lama_pipeline.py
```
